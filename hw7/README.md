There are total 4 code files:
q1.py
q2_2.py
q2_3_2.py
q2_3_3.py

For each problem, run the corresponding file

    $ python filename.py

q1.py will plot the the cluster centers

q2_2.py will implement recommend the joke by its average rating in the training set. and
find the k nearest neighbors of him/her, then make the prediction by averaging the ratings of these neighbors. 
Then, report the result of accuracy.

q2_3_2.py get the SVD of R matrix then combine U, s, to U. Using U and V with the given d value.
Slicing the rows and columns form U and V and report the MSE and validation set accuracy

q2_3_3.py get random initial enties for U and V with given size of d, then learning and converge U and V to make
MSE become lower.  Finally, report the MSE and validation set accuracy
